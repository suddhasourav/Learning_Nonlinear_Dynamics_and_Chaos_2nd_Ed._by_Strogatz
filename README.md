# Learning *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, 2nd Ed.*, by Steven Strogatz

Self-studying Strogatz's *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*, I realized that Google Colab + GitHub would be a good place to document the explorations.

Here, I document my learning progress and explorations. Notes, analyses and plots are embedded in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. The *scipy*, *numpy* and *matplotlib* libraries are heavily used.

Future students can copy, adapt and play around with these notebooks to gain insight.
