Learning Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, 2nd Ed., by Steven Strogatz

Self-studying Strogatz's Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, I realized that colab + github would be a good place to document the explorations.
Code is not mature, but I do plan to make them usable for other students who might be intersted to play around.
